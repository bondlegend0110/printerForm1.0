                <p class="mission-text">We aim to create a more accessible tool that introduces basic 3D modeling and
                    3D printing into educational and creative spaces. It does not replace traditional
                    plastic 3D printing but it hopefully provides an opportunity to create quick mock-ups,
                    test, and iterate ideas. Using common materials like an inkjet or laser printer, 8.5”x11”
                    paper, and PrinterForm anyone can practice their 3D modeling skills and produce high speed,
                    low resolution 3D objects.
